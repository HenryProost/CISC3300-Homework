1. What is javascript? How does an interpreted programming language differ from a
compiled language?
JavaScript is used to help develope webpages and allows for interactive and dynamic content on websites.
An interpreted langauge differes from a compiled language because the code is executed line by line and does not 
need to be compiled at run time such as C++.

2. Contrast dynamically typed programming languages with statically typed ones. And
contrast strongly typed programming languages with weakly typed ones. (google these)
Dynamically typed programming languages dont need to define types when declaring variables
vs a statically typed langauge that needs a type when declaring variables.
Strongly typed languages cannot change variable types once it is assigned vs a weakly
typed langauge in which a variable can be implicitly changed

3. What is the difference between var, let, and const when declaring variables in JS?
var isnt typically used anymore and can be redefined 
let variables are variables that can be redefined and changed
const variables are variables that once assigned a value cannot be changed 
both let and const variables are block-scoped 

4. What are anonymous functions? Higher order functions? Callback functions? First class
functions?
Anonymous functions are functions that are defined without a name
Higher order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments
Callback functions are functions that are passed as an argument to another function
FIrst-class functions are functions that can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, 
and returned from other functions

5. Define objects in JavaScript.
Objects are collections of key-value pairs that are typically strings
